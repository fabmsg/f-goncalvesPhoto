# Filipe Gonçalves Photography Portfolio

Static photography portfolio designed for GitHub Pages, inspired by the original site at
[f-goncalves.com](https://www.f-goncalves.com). The site highlights seascapes, portraits,
travel stories, services, and links to other ventures.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page with hero showcase and featured stories.
- `gallery.html` – Curated photography galleries across seascapes, portraits, and travel.
- `about.html` – Biography, philosophy, clients, and exhibitions.
- `services.html` – Overview of services, process, and booking information.
- `business.html` – Links to The Atlantic Wave, Plan Sync Go, and The Story Wall.
- `assets/css/styles.css` – Global styling and layout rules.

## Local Development

Open the `index.html` file in your browser or serve the folder with a static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

The site is ready for GitHub Pages. Commit the files to the repository and enable GitHub
Pages from the repository settings, pointing to the `main` branch (or `docs` folder if
preferred).
